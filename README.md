# Getting Started with Fiscus Auth Redirect

Welcome to the **Fiscus Auth Redirect App**! This is a lightweight React app tailored for handling OAuth2 redirects. The app captures essential parameters, such as `code`, `state`, and other query data from the URL, and forwards them to the Fiscus server to complete the OAuth2 process. **Fiscus** provides a universal API for connecting AI Agents and LLMs to a wide range of APIs.

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Starts the app in development mode.  
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.  
Check the console for any lint errors.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the [running tests guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode, optimizing performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, see [this section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### npm run eject

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need full control over the build configuration, you can `eject`.  
This command copies configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you complete customization ability. From here, you manage everything manually.

### Learn More
